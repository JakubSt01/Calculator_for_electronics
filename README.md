# Calculator_for_electronics

Calculator, designed with electronics in mind, enables quick conversion between numerical systems such as decimal, octal, hexadecimal, and binary. It also features basic mathematical functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, facilitating everyday calculations in electronics work. The optimized user interface allows easy switching between functions, enhancing the tool's usability.

To ensure user security and improve interaction with the calculator, various safeguards have been implemented. Inputting data from an on-screen keyboard helps avoid errors related to data entry. Error messages notify users of the impossibility of dividing by 0, and the result of such an operation is marked as "NaN" (not a number). Additionally, when converting data between numerical systems, it is necessary to add appropriate prefixes, such as "0x" for hexadecimal, "0o" for octal, and "0b" for binary.

Despite its simplicity, the project focuses on delivering an efficient tool that meets the needs of electronics or computer professionals in their daily work, while also enabling the acquisition of valuable programming skills.
